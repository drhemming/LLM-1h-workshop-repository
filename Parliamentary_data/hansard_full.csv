Quote,Speaker,Year
"When the House resumes next week the Government will look to progress the Rugby World Cup 2011 (Empowering) Bill, the Governor-General Bill, and other Treaty settlement legislation.",Hon JOHN CARTER,2010
"Regarding the intention of the Government to pursue the Rugby World Cup 2011 (Empowering) Bill, I wonder whether the acting Leader of the House could tell us whether the Government has had a chance to consider the amendments promoted by Mr Mallard to temper some of the sweeping powers available to the Minister for the Rugby World Cup under that legislation, to ensure that the bill can return to being a bipartisan bill, which it has been up until this point. I know that Mr Mallard put those amendments on the Table, and if the Committee stage will take place next week that information would assist the Opposition in its planning as to whether it can cooperate with the Government on that measure.",Hon DARREN HUGHES,2010
"I am afraid I do not know the answer to that. However, the Government is taking these matters seriously. I will find out and see whether I can have the member informed about that.",Hon JOHN CARTER,2010
"Does he stand by his statement that ""it's essential that we reduce New Zealand's vulnerability to future shocks because, as we've seen with the current recession, economic conditions can change extremely quickly""; and, if so, is he confident that all his infrastructure investments reduce our vulnerability to future shocks?",Dr RUSSEL NORMAN,2010
"Yes. The Government is investing billions of dollars into strengthening the national electricity grid, setting out to roll broadband out across the country, plus putting very heavy investments into roading and rail. These will both increase the resilience of our economy and underpin stronger growth in the future.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
How will the $11 billion that his Government is spending on new high-cost motorways do anything to reduce the vulnerability of our economy to oil price shocks?,Dr Russel Norman,2010
"The investment in roads is freeing up congestion and lifting our export productivity. If oil prices rise, then I am sure that people will make their choices about whether to travel more or less, or whether to change their mode of transport. It is our guess that even if oil prices rise, most people still will want to travel by private car.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
What are some of the economic benefits of the Government's programme of infrastructure investment?,Jo Goodhew,2010
"In the long run it will improve the quality of our infrastructure, consistent with a growing economy, and help to lift New Zealand's productivity. In the short term our infrastructure investment is supporting the economy. Eighty percent of the major construction jobs\'97that is, jobs worth over $5 million\'97are being funded by the Government, according to Pacifecon's recent survey of activity, and over half of all non-residential building consents are for Government-related work, which is the highest percentage in 20 years. So the infrastructure investment is also underpinning thousands of jobs.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
"When he says it is his ""guess"" that people will change their behaviour in certain ways during an oil price shock, has the Government done any studies or conducted any research into what the actual impact of an oil price shock would be on transport decision-making?",Dr Russel Norman,2010
"I could go and check whether the Government has done that\'97perhaps the previous Government may well have done, because there was an oil price spike a few years ago. But we can see that the whole transport industry has been thinking that through. For instance, one effect might be an even faster move towards much more fuel-efficient cars or a switch to electricity. Those cars would still require roads to be driven on.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
"T\uc0\u275 n\u257  koe, Mr Speaker. Kia ora t\u257 tou. Does he agree that the country's current measurement of economic progress, GDP, is highly susceptible to these economic shocks, and what will he do to progress the implementation of the genuine progress index, which, as a more holistic measure of economic progress, would be less susceptible to economic shocks?",Te Ururoa Flavell,2010
"The Government accepts that GDP is not a total measure of welfare or even of those things that are desirable for the Government to achieve. That is one reason why, for instance, the Government is now publishing immunisation rates in the newspaper every quarter, to demonstrate to the public the progress that we are making on immunising children. It is also a reason why the Government is introducing national standards as a measure of literacy and numeracy. They are the basic requirements for competent citizenship.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
"In reference to the work that the Government may or may not have done on the impact of oil price shocks, can he confirm that oil price shocks have not been considered in any of the business cases for the roads of national significance?",Dr Russel Norman,2010
"I simply cannot answer that question, but I would be willing to go and find out.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
"In light of the fact that oil price shocks have not been considered in any of the business cases, does he accept that an oil price shock would reduce the benefits in the business cases for building those motorways and would also increase the construction costs\'97so an oil price shock would change the benefit to cost ratio by reducing the benefits and increasing the costs?",Dr Russel Norman,2010
"In some respects, it is fairly obvious that if the prices were different, the business case would look a bit different. But the lesson from past surges in oil prices is that although people may change to more efficient cars or different types of fuel, the private car is likely to remain a vastly dominant form of transport, no matter how much we spend on railways. If the dominant form is not cars, then it is buses, and they still need roads.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
"Does he agree that there are opportunity costs in spending $11 billion on new motorway projects, in that he will have less money available to invest in projects that would give New Zealanders real options, such as better buses and trains, walking, and cycling?",Dr Russel Norman,2010
"Well, there are always opportunity costs in making a particular investment, but the investment in roads assists with what is actually a more efficient mode of public transport than rail, and that is buses. They need basically the same system as cars. The member may be interested to look in detail at some of the cost-benefit analysis on rail, because although he thinks that roads are vulnerable to oil shocks, most rail investment cases do not stack up without a very large public-good element to cover the big difference between the costs and the benefits.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
"In the light of an oil price shock, does he think that the benefit-cost ratio would look better for a new motorway project or a new rail project, and hence, that if he included oil price shocks in the studies of the benefit to cost for these two projects, actually rail would look much better, in the case of an oil price shock, than new motorways?",Dr Russel Norman,2010
"I have not personally done those calculations, but my guess is that we would need to have a very high oil price to make the cost-benefit ratio on rail look better. If the oil price was high, we would have to presume most people would shift to rail, but even if the volumes on rail doubled or trebled, the economics of it are still very marginal.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
"Does he stand by his statement on 18 December 2008, a month after the general election, that ""I want to stress that New Zealand starts from a reasonable position in dealing with the uncertainty of our economic outlook""?",Hon ANNETTE KING,2010
"In respect of the relative level of public debt at the time, yes, I do. But that was really the only economic indicator that was positive. The Government had at the time produced a Budget forecasting rising unemployment, inflation over 5 percent, a decade of deficits, and private debt in New Zealand out of control, as well as a housing bubble and a failing export sector.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
"What did he mean when he also said on 18 December 2008, after the election and after the global financial crisis had hit, that ""In New Zealand we have room to respond. This is the rainy day the Government has been saving up for.""; and did it relate to the previous Government paying off debt, even when criticised by him for doing so?",Hon Annette King,2010
"What I meant was exactly what the statement referred to, and that is that at the time Government debt was relatively low, although I might say that the Government did not actually pay off debt. The economy grew and, relative to the economy, the debt stayed flat. I point out to the member that a headline at the time stated: ""Treasury books a sea of red ink"". That was after the Government's Budget. Another headline stated: ""Economic update shows growth in all the wrong places"". [Interruption] If Labour does not understand what a mess it left the economy in, then it does not understand the economy.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. My question was very straight. The answer did not require the nastiness at the end of it about the previous Labour Government.",Hon Annette King,2010
"I listened very carefully to the question, and I listened very carefully to the answer. The member's colleagues interjected very robustly on what the Minister was saying. The Minister was giving a very reasoned answer to the member's question, and the member's colleagues gave a barrage of interjections. The Minister picked up on those interjections and responded, and he is at liberty to do that. I cannot insist that the Minister behave in an exemplary fashion if the member's own colleagues let fly a barrage of interjections. It has to work fairly on both sides.",Mr SPEAKER,2010
"Was the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Alan Bollard, correct when he said in 2008 that New Zealand has ""enjoyed a decade of growth, the longest period of economic growth since post World War II era. Inflation has been low, averaging 2.2 percent since 1998.""; if not, why does he believe that Dr Bollard is correct now when he says that inflation would be around 2 percent in 2012-13?",Hon Annette King,2010
"I disagree with the Governor of the Reserve Bank's assessment of the economy at that time. In fact, inflation was over 5 percent that is a matter of fact the Government's books were heading into the red, the export sector had been shrinking for 5 years, Government spending was out of control, and unemployment was heading up. And that was before the global financial crisis.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
What reports has he seen about the state of the economy in late 2008?,Amy Adams,2010
"I have seen this one from the Press from 7 October 2008. Under the headline: ""Grim numbers"" it talks about a cash deficit of $5.9 billion that financial year, and $30 billion over 4 years; house prices down by 11 percent by March, the consumer price index at 4.5 percent; debt ballooning to 24.5 percent of GDP by 2012; tax revenues down $3.1 billion; and the current account deficit at $14.5 billion\'97which was pretty much close to a record. That is what was said at the time. Treasury books were a sea of red ink\'97grim numbers.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
"Was the Governor of the Reserve Bank correct when he said: ""The international financial crisis actually played little role in the early part of New Zealand's economic recession. Rather, it was drought, falling house prices and higher petrol prices that dragged New Zealand GDP growth negative over the first three quarters of 2008."", and has he put in place policies to control drought, higher petrol prices, and falling house prices; if not, why not?",Hon Annette King,2010
"The Government has put in place policies to ensure that this economy is more resilient and will grow more strongly. That means avoiding the excesses that occurred in this economy from 2005 onwards, when bad policy and mismanagement by the Labour Government meant that our export sector shrank to the point where there were no more jobs in it in 2010 than there were in 2000. That was a disgrace.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
"Was the International Monetary Fund correct when it stated soon after the election of 2008 that ""New Zealand is in a better position than most advanced countries to face the global storm, given its sound macroeconomic policies, including a flexible exchange rate, low level of public debt, flexible labour markets, and a healthy banking sector.""; if so, what has the Government done in the last 18 months to turn our economy into such a mess?",Hon Annette King,2010
"If the member is quoting the International Monetary Fund on those sound macro policies, why is the Labour Party now adopting policies designed to destroy all those sound settings? The Labour Party cannot have it both ways. The fact is that this economy was in recession from the beginning of 2008, it was left in a mess by the previous Government, and we are turning it round.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
"Was the Minister, in making his statement on 18 December 2008, concerned at the huge surge in public spending, from 29 percent of GDP to 34.7 percent of GDP, that occurred between 2004 and 2008 as the Labour Government abandoned all fiscal restraint; if so, what measures are being taken to wind back spending?",Hon Sir Roger Douglas,2010
"Yes, we were concerned about that. The primary action the Government has taken is that it has reprioritised $4 billion of that spending from the excessive back-office bureaucracy to effective front-line services, and it has put in place an annual limit of $1.1 billion of new spending. That is bringing much more fiscal discipline and much better stewardship of taxpayers' money to the Government sector.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
"Was the International Monetary Fund correct when it said just after the election in 2008, when commenting on the global financial crisis, that the average advanced country was starting with debt of about 80 percent of GDP but that New Zealand's gross debt was around 20 percent and that, in net terms, it had positive financial assets; and after the many examples I have given today\'97from the Governor of the Reserve Bank to the International Monetary Fund\'97is the Minister saying that these leading economists are wrong, and why does he continue to say that he inherited a mess when, quite plainly, he did not?",Hon Annette King,2010
"I have let the House know about all the measures of the mess the economy was in. Government debt was relatively low but the last Budget of the Labour Government resulted in this headline: ""Treasury books a sea of red ink"". In the 2008 Budget, before the global financial crisis, the Cullen Government delivered 10 years of deficits. That is what it forecast. So even the one thing that was in better condition, Labour was in the process of wrecking.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
"Does the Minister agree that Labour's last term in Government demonstrates the urgent need for a taxpayers' bill of rights that caps per capita Government spending so that a desperate and dying Government cannot attempt to buy itself another term and would, instead, be forced to go back to taxpayers and seek their authorisation for further increases in Government spending; if not, why not?",Hilary Calvert,2010
"There is no doubt that the experience of those years has meant that this Government has had to tighten up, very considerably, on what was sloppy and ineffective and, in some cases, negligent management of public resources. A taxpayers bill of rights would be one way to bring more fiscal discipline to Governments, and we are willing to discuss whether that would be effective.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
Has the Government estimated the cost to the taxpayer of the interest rate premium the Government is paying as a result of the Minister's loss of credibility as Minister of Finance because of his housing scandal?,Hon Trevor Mallard,2010
I rule that question out of order because the member has made an allegation that is totally inappropriate. The member cannot make that kind of allegation against another member of this House. The Standing Orders are very clear on that.,Mr SPEAKER,2010
"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Are you ruling that there was no housing scandal?",Hon Trevor Mallard,2010
"I rule that it is inappropriate for a member in this House to claim in a supplementary question that there was a housing scandal. If the member looks at the Standing Orders\'97probably Standing Order 371\'97he will see that questions must not contain expressions of opinion in respect of that kind of thing. Whether it was a scandal is an expression of opinion, and questions should not make that kind of allegation. I think the member is quite lucky I did not let the Minister loose, because the Minister might have dumped pretty severely on the questioner. [Interruption] Interjections should at least be humorous and, above all, not nasty. There is no need for nasty interjections in this House. If members want to get nasty, they should get out of the House. While I am Speaker I have no [Interruption] There should be no comments. I do not want to hear nasty interjections.",Mr SPEAKER,2010
What were some of the other significant economic problems facing New Zealand around the time of the 2008 general election?,Amy Adams,2010
"I will give just a few indications of the problems this country had. Government spending had been growing at more than twice the rate of the economy, and at the same time the export sector had been in recession from 2003 to 2005. Over that period there were no net new jobs in agriculture, forestry, or manufacturing. By the end of 2008 inflation was at 5 percent, which was the highest annual rate for two decades. Real after-tax wages were falling, which left families worse off. A month later Treasury forecasts painted a very bleak picture of the Government's books\'97never-ending deficits and ever-soaring debt.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
"If the previous Minister of Finance was so hopelessly incompetent to mismanage the books in that way, why did the National Government appoint him to chair the country's largest State-owned enterprise?",Hon David Cunliffe,2010
"I think he was actually not too bad, up to the point where that member became an Associate Minister of Finance.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. That was a misrepresentation, and I want to give a clarification under the Standing Orders. I was not an Associate Minister of Finance in the year to which the Minister was referring.",Hon David Cunliffe,2010
"The member cannot use a point of order to do that, although I have some sympathy with the member's feeling the need to do so. But he cannot actually use a point of order for that purpose.",Mr SPEAKER,2010
What are the consequences of unsustainable increases in public spending that lead to budget deficits getting out of control?,Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga,2010
"Countries that allow their deficits to get out of control can end up in considerable difficulty. For instance, I have seen reports overnight that Britain is being forced to make the largest cuts to public spending since World War II, in a 5-year austerity plan that could cost nearly half a million jobs. Governments that let deficits get out of control find themselves in a position where they have to make drastic decisions rather than considered decisions.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010

[In the first instance, my acknowledgment to you, my chiefs and elder brothers. Huge, enormous, and immense greetings to you, the people of T\u363 wharetoa, Raukawa, and Te Arawa.] It is a wonderful event when people turn up to Parliament to hear the third reading for the passing of a bill that is particular to their area, and particular to the whole Treaty settlement process. They do not turn up just to have a jack, they do not come just to have a cup of tea, and they do not come just to have a few parliamentary biscuits and what have you. They come to see a bit of history. They come to see the job being done.",Hon TAU HENARE,2010
"I think that all members in this House today have the responsibility, given the level of goodwill that there is towards this bill and its provisions, to put our weight behind mediating those inevitable disputes, the consequences of the implementation of this bill. Certainly, for the Greens, I can commit to that. We will continue to lend our support to the implementation as well as to the passing of this bill. We will all be the richer for it, as will the natural world that surrounds and sustains us. Finally, I again pay my respects and offer our regards to ng\uc0\u257  iwi of the Waikato, who are taking on this final hurdle, as our colleague Tau Henare mentioned.",David Clendon,2010
"Kia ora, Mr Deputy Speaker. To all those people up in the gallery, I say that I would not call them a crowd. I think they bring much more significance, in being with us today. I would probably call them an ope. To the people of Te Arawa, Ng\uc0\u257 ti T\u363 wharetoa, and Ng\u257 ti Raukawa I say welcome and thank them for making the journey yet again to share their stories, their history, and their past with us in the House who are just doing the bidding of drafting legislation and getting it to the House.

"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I seek leave to move a motion without notice and without debate to honour veterans on the 73rd anniversary of the Battle of El Alamein\'97",DARROCH BALL,2015
Order! I will just put the leave to see whether the members are happy. Leave is sought to move that particular motion without debate. Is there any objection? There is objection.,Mr SPEAKER,2015
Does she stand by all her statements?,DARROCH BALL,2015
"Yes, when taken in context.",Hon ANNE TOLLEY,2015
"Does she stand by her statement in relation to the army-run Limited Service Volunteer programme that ""as the total number of young people on benefits drops, so too does the number of suitable clients who are likely to benefit from attending the LSV programme."";?",Darroch Ball,2015
"In relation to where it is an accurate quote from me, yes, I have said in this House that as we have seen the number of young people on benefits drop, we have refined the numbers of young people who are suitable to go into that course.",Hon ANNE TOLLEY,2015
"How can she guarantee that demand for Limited Service Volunteer programme places has actually reduced when she has admitted that the Ministry of Social Development does not even report on the number of applications for the course and she is just relying on the fact that ""the likely number of young people at long-term risk of unemployment has reduced.""",Darroch Ball,2015
"I rely on advice from officials who are working with these young people every day. If the need arises and the demand increases, then we will have a look at it again.",Hon ANNE TOLLEY,2015
"If she honestly believes in a direct, evidence-based approach, then how can she prove that only 800 out of 25,000 unemployed youth are suitable for this course?",Darroch Ball,2015
"As I said, I rely on advice from the officials and, also, from those who are working with young people on a daily basis. We are conducting those courses, we are paying for those courses, and they are having a great effect on the young people involved.",Hon ANNE TOLLEY,2015
"Will she admit that the Wellington Limited Service Volunteer course was not shut down because of a supposed reduction in demand but because the 5-year lease on its facility ended on 1 January this year, it was put up for sale in April, then, coincidently, there was a cut to the Limited Service Volunteer programme in April, and the building was sold in June?",Darroch Ball,2015
All I can say is that all of that is news to me.,Hon ANNE TOLLEY,2015
"It should not be. Does she have any immediate plans to further reduce the number of places in the Limited Service Volunteer programme; if so, why?",Darroch Ball,2015
The Hon Anne Tolley\'97either of those two supplementary questions.,Mr SPEAKER,2015
"No. We have allocated 800 places, and we are prepared to pay for 800 places, but we continue to look at whether we have the right young people going into that course, whether it will help, and whether that will then help them to get employment when they have completed the course.",Hon ANNE TOLLEY,2015
"How can the answer possibly be ""No."", and how can she explain the reason the Auckland-based programme is now being moved to a temporary site\'97a scout hall\'97and plans are currently under way to shut it down completely at the end of 2017?",Darroch Ball,2015
"I do not know where this member gets his information from, but what I can say is that the Ministry of Social Development is working in partnership with the Defence Force to provide this course and to support young people who are suitable for undertaking the Limited Service Volunteer course\'97and not all are\'97in order to help them to gain motivation, to gain some physical skills, and to prepare them for employment. We will continue to do that, and the funding is in the 4-year plan out beyond 2017.",Hon ANNE TOLLEY,2015
There are a number of documents I am seeking leave to table.,Darroch Ball,2015
"Order! Are they documents that\'97[Interruption] Order! Before I put the leave, are they documents that are freely available to members?",Mr SPEAKER,2015
No.,Darroch Ball,2015
"With assurance that they are not, then I will listen very briefly to the documents. If there are too many, I will deem that you are trying only to make a political point and I will then\'97[Interruption] Order! I am speaking. If there are too many, I will then decide not to put the leave. So I will invite the member to list the documents, and I will make a judgment.",Mr SPEAKER,2015
"The first is the Official Information Act document from the headquarters of the New Zealand Defence Force titled Downsizing the Youth Development Unit, dated 14 June 2015. The second is an Official Information Act document from the headquarters of the New Zealand Defence Force titled Limited Service Volunteer Validation, dated 2014. I have six Limited Service Volunteer operational group meeting minutes dated from 15 April to 19 August 2015, which state the move of the Limited Service Volunteer Auckland programme to a temporary scout hall and that considerations are under way to shut it down completely. Also, the last is the lease agreement between the New Zealand Defence Force and the Ministry of Education, dated 26 June 2010, showing the expiry date of that lease being 1 January.",Darroch Ball,2015

"Is it correct that according to Statistics New Zealand figures, real seasonally adjusted GDP per capita growth in the first 6 months of this year was the worst it has been since 2010?",GRANT ROBERTSON,2015
"Statistics New Zealand reports that real seasonally adjusted per capita GDP, in the 3 months to June 2015, was $11,924. In December 2014 this quarterly figure was $11,964, the highest ever reading for this series. That is the smallest change for any 6-month period since 2010. However, I would note that most respected commentators use GDP per capita on an annual basis, and by that measure GDP per capita is growing. I would also point out that it is easy to grow GDP per capita when a stadium's worth of people are leaving the country each year, as they were under the previous Labour Government in 2008.",Hon PAULA BENNETT,2015
"Can the Minister confirm that the first 6 months of this year saw a 0.2 percent negative GDP per capita growth, and is this reflective of a successful economy?",Grant Robertson,2015
"Yes, but annual GDP growth between June 2014 and June 2015 was actually 2.4 percent, and, as I say, most commentators would take it from an annual GDP per capita basis, and we are very confident that this actual calendar year will also see a growth.",Hon PAULA BENNETT,2015
"How is it a sign of success for the New Zealand economy that we have now been added to HSBC's watch-list of nations that it has a concern about due to our overreliance on China, falling commodity prices, and the Auckland housing bubble?",Grant Robertson,2015
"To quote from HSBC, it says ""Although low risk, New Zealand may be one to watch."", so I think that needs to be kept in the context of what it actually is. I find it ironic that, when we are about to sign a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that actually sees us extend wider than just the Chinese market, Labour does not quite know where it stands on that and is not supporting what would be a real economic growth for this country across more than just the market of China.",Hon PAULA BENNETT,2015
Does it surprise the Minister that the Opposition spokesperson on finance ties his credibility to a report from a foreign bank?,Hon Gerry Brownlee,2015
Order! There is no ministerial responsibility there.,Mr SPEAKER,2015
Is the Minister proud to be managing an economy that makes the global headlines that these are the economies that could run into trouble?,Grant Robertson,2015
"What I am proud of is to actually have an economy that has had 18 straight quarters of economic growth, 11 straight quarters of job growth, with 69,000 more jobs just in the last year, and a stable outlook for moderate economic growth. What I will note is that most other OECD countries would like a Prime Minister like John Key, a finance Minister like our Minister of Finance, and an economy like ours. They would just like a stronger Opposition.",Hon PAULA BENNETT,2015
"Does he think that unemployment of 6 percent, which some economists say will rise to 7 percent, is part of a successful economy?",Grant Robertson,2015
"What I would also note, though, is that the Reserve Bank Governor just recently has said that the forecasting that he was predicting 6 months ago actually has not fallen as badly, that we are seeing growth in the manufacturing sector since a crisis was called by the Labour Party. We are seeing beef increase, and we have seen 69,000 more jobs just over the last 12 months. So what we are seeing is real growth in jobs. We have also got one of the strongest labour markets in the country as far as participation is concerned and a net migration, quite frankly, that is at an all-time high.",Hon PAULA BENNETT,2015
"According to the latest household labour force survey, how many New Zealanders are currently unemployed?",Grant Robertson,2015
"Sorry, I do not have that at the top of my notes here and cannot remember the exact figure, but what I would say is that, actually, one of our highest rates of labour force participation actually shows confidence in the numbers of those who are actually in the workforce and looking.",Hon PAULA BENNETT,2015
"How can the Minister judge the economy a success, when we are on an international watch-list of concern, housing is the most unaffordable that it has been in 60 years, exports as a percentage of GDP are the lowest since 1997, and, to help the Minister out, 148,000 New Zealanders are unemployed?",Grant Robertson,2015
"I know that that member is making a career out of trying to talk down our economy, and actually does not have the view that we are growing, that we are sustainable. We are still looking at GDP growth of around 2 percent, which actually is considered low risk. They cannot actually get it together enough to recognise the benefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will grow us beyond just that Chinese market and see other sectors, apart from dairy, also growing.",Hon PAULA BENNETT,2015
How is the Government's economic plan managing the challenges presented by low inflation and the outlook for the global economy?,PAUL FOSTER-BELL,2015
"The current mix of lower dairy prices, low inflation, and a weaker global economic outlook means lower expected growth in tax revenues for the Government, despite rising real wages for New Zealand households. The Government's plan in response to this weaker outlook for revenue growth is to focus on managing expenditure. We are working to make each dollar go further rather than cutting spending or services.",Hon PAULA BENNETT,2015
What progress has the Government made in balancing its books in the past 5 years?,Paul Foster-Bell,2015
"The Government has made good progress on balancing its books and getting back into surplus. In 2010-11 the Government recorded a deficit of $18.4 billion, or 9 percent of GDP, on the back of the global financial crisis and, of course, the Canterbury earthquakes. In the years following, the Government recorded smaller deficits each year, and last week the Government announced a $414 million surplus for the 2014-15 year. This met the target, of course, that we set in 2011. This result is due in part to the Government's careful management of expenditure, which has fallen from 34 percent of GDP in 2011 to 30 percent of GDP in 2015.",Hon PAULA BENNETT,2015
How will the Government's prudent fiscal management help New Zealand manage future uncertainties?,Paul Foster-Bell,2015
"Like many New Zealand households, the Government has weekly obligations that it must meet and finances to balance. By analogy, if the Government were the average New Zealand household it would have had an income last year of $90,900, expenses of $90,500, and a $400 surplus at the year end. This Government household would have debt of $76,000 and it would be paying $59 per week in interest. So we are reasonably well positioned to weather future uncertainties. What is important is that we continue to work towards paying down that debt while continuing to meet our commitments to New Zealanders.",Hon PAULA BENNETT,2015
What recent reports has the Minister received on GDP per capita?,Paul Foster-Bell,2015
"The Minister has seen a report from one high-profile economic commentator\'97I think he means Grant Robertson suggesting GDP per capita is falling. Not everybody knows that there is more than one measure of GDP or that per capita GDP is generally measured on an annual basis. Like most statistics, per capita GDP will fluctuate from quarter to quarter.",Hon PAULA BENNETT,2015
Do you know what you're saying?,David Shearer,2015
"You will learn something. On an annual basis, GDP per capita is growing, despite record high net migration. In the year to June per capita GDP at current prices grew 2.1 percent. In real terms it grew 0.4 percent. That commentator will also be assured by the\'97",Hon PAULA BENNETT,2015
Order! That question is a marginal question. I suspect it was designed to attack the Opposition.,Mr SPEAKER,2015
Does she believe that community housing providers will have to be commercial in order to be sustainable?,PHIL TWYFORD,2015
"Yes. It kind of makes sense that to be financially sustainable into the future, as they are growing their portfolios, they may need to be commercial in their outlook as well.",Hon PAULA BENNETT,2015
"Are chirping birds in the neighbours' trees a truly representative reason some people are turning down State houses, or is the real reason that cold, damp, mouldy houses are making their children sick?",Phil Twyford,2015
"We have a number of declines about 3,500 in any one year\'97and about 12 percent of them are not for good and sufficient reasons. So one would say that the other over 3,000 of them are, and some of them might be those reasons. We take that into consideration to make sure that we are keeping people in the types of houses they need to be in and that they are still connected to jobs and schools. But there are some who are turning down houses who should not be. In the meantime, we have people in dire need who actually need those houses, and they should have access to them.",Hon PAULA BENNETT,2015
"Why does she constantly engage in snide attacks on the most vulnerable citizens when the reality is that under her Government there are more Kiwis than ever before living in campgrounds and garages while she leaves 2,000 State houses vacant?",Phil Twyford,2015
"Well, I just say: ""Look in the mirror, 'Mr Snide .""",Hon PAULA BENNETT,2015
"Is she surprised that community housing providers are cynical about her approach, given that she started off saying the State house sell-off was all about building up local community groups, and now the Government is courting property developers, merchant bankers, and Australian companies?",Phil Twyford,2015
"Well, we have always thought it would take a consortium to help actually grow the community housing providers so that we can have a range of skills that are needed. As I said this morning to Community Housing Aotearoa, it is very good with people, and that is its strength, and its tenancy management. What it may need to do is to go into a consortium with banks so that it can actually see that portfolio grow, and that makes perfect sense. In fact, I have quotes from the member where last year in his speech he said: ""Your members have shown you can build good-quality homes at a very affordable price. You can leverage private sector investment."" And that was Phil Twyford.",Hon PAULA BENNETT,2015
"Why should the public believe her spin about improving the lives of tenants when the Government has taken half a billion dollars out of Housing New Zealand, leaving 2,000 houses vacant while Kiwi families are living in campgrounds, and has cut the number of State houses by a thousand, in net, since it came\'97",Phil Twyford,2015
Order! The question is quite long enough.,Mr SPEAKER,2015
"Well, we are housing more people in better-quality homes, and that is why the wait list is going down. We have spent $600,000 to date on housing support products that help people into the private market. Just this year alone we have seen actually the amount that we are spending on the income-related rent go up by $75 million, and that is making an absolute difference for those people. I know that the member would like it all to stay the same, and he thinks that the status quo is good enough. But it is actually not good enough for the people who need our help. [Interruption]",Hon PAULA BENNETT,2015
"Order! [Interruption] Order! Phil Twyford will stand, withdraw, and apologise for that remark.",Mr SPEAKER,2015
I rise to pass a few comments and a few thanks at the end of my 7 years as a member of this Parliament and 9 years as co-leader of the Green Party. I want to start with a little story from Queensland. Some of you may know that I was born in Brisbane...,Dr RUSSEL NORMAN,2015
"The second institution that I think really matters is the media, the fourth estate. This is not a complaint about a status quo bias to the media. Sure, the media does have a status quo bias. Media institutions are large financial institutions, existing in the status quo, and no one should be surprised that they do tend to have a bias towards the status quo. That is not my gripe. My gripe is the resources available to journalists. Journalists used to have to produce one or two stories a week in some cases. Now they have to produce four a day. It is very difficult for journalists to do their role in our society, to hold the Government and powerful institutions to account, when journalists do not have the resources to do their job. I think this is a problem for all of us, and I think it is a problem for our democracy.",Dr Russel Norman,2015
"One of the great things about my job is that I went on this dirty rivers tour. You know, I went and paddled in lots of dirty rivers\'97dozens of them; not hard to find\'97and there are communities all around the country that are trying to protect their rivers. There are courageous people in rural communities who are speaking out about the impact of dairy intensification on their rivers and their communities and we need to listen to the voices of those people. I do not think that leadership is going to come from Government and I do not think it is going to come from the industry, because there has been plenty of time to fix this problem and it is not getting any better\'97it is getting radically worse. It is going to rely, I think, on the NGO sector and the community sector to speak out in order to save our rivers and to protect the natural...",Dr Russel Norman,2015
"In conclusion, I would just like to say that my view is that humanity faces some really big challenges in the decades ahead, particularly around sustainability and climate change, and around inequality and poverty, but also around democracy. I think that democracy faces some big challenges globally, actually. But we also have huge opportunities. So, although I say that the world is finite\'97that is true\'97but human creativity is infinite. Human generosity is infinite. Human courage is infinite. So we have access to some fantastic resources. As well as facing these big challenges and problems we have inherited from the past, we have also inherited lots of great things from the past as well, and we have the opportunity to really create a world of abundance for everyone and for all of us living within the finite limits of the natural world. I think that it is an opportunity that we really should grasp with both our hands, because our children deserve nothing less. Finally, I would like to dedicate my time here to the people who stand up for a better world regardless of the cost. We are all entitled to be agitators, as Justice Murphy said, and we should exercise that entitlement frequently, and I intend to do so. Kia kaha.",Dr Russel Norman,2015

How is the Government ensuring that New Zealand's firefighters are properly equipped and resourced to safely respond to fires happening across Aotearoa recently?,Teanau Tuiono,2025
"on behalf of the Minister of Internal Affairs: I answered a near identical question at great length yesterday, and I would like to refer the member to those answers. I would also like to give thanks to the work of Fire and Emergency New Zealand (FENZ) at this very difficult time with several areas under a state of emergency with fires and severe weather. Their work is always invaluable and deeply valued by New Zealanders on a day like today.",Hon DAVID SEYMOUR,2025
"Are firefighters correct when they say they have to work with equipment that consistently breaks down, with no fleet replacement strategy, and are right now across the country putting their safety at risk protecting our communities from severe weather?",Teanau Tuiono,2025
"On behalf of the Minister of Internal Affairs, I don't believe that that statement is correct. The Government in the last two years has seen FENZ introduce an asset management plan, which had not been put in place, for some reason, between 2017 and 2023 after FENZ was formed from the voluntary and professional wings of New Zealand's firefighting. The replacement schedule for fire appliances I traversed in detail yesterday, but the Government currently has, I believe, 78 appliances on order. They tend to take 18 to 24 months to deliver because they're highly specialised equipment; five of those are aerial. In total, FENZ is spending around $20 million to $25 million each year on upgrading fire appliances.",Hon DAVID SEYMOUR,2025
"Is it correct that in the past year the fire truck compliance servicing provider has done 446 emergency callouts, more than one a day, due to breakdowns of the ageing fleet?",Teanau Tuiono,2025
"On behalf of the Minister of Internal Affairs, I don't have verification of that exact figure in front of me, but it may well be true. There are thousands of fire appliances in New Zealand. Of course, if there was to be one callout for a breakdown each day, then that's something, perhaps, the member could imagine.",Hon DAVID SEYMOUR,2025
"Is it correct that the state of the fire appliances is dire and failing, leaving firefighters stranded on the way to calls, at station, or even at incidents without water while internal firefighting?",Teanau Tuiono,2025
"On behalf of the Minister of Internal Affairs, no, that characterisation is not correct. I've been advised that, for example, there has only been one recent breakdown that led to a two-minute delay in getting to a fire\'97that's in the past several months, at least. So I think the characterisation of routine breakdowns and danger is simply not sustainable. I do note that due to current industrial negotiations, there appears to be a concerted campaign by some in the fire service, and particularly the New Zealand Professional Firefighters Union, to try and emphasise any incident and present it as being routine when, in fact, that characterisation is not true.",Hon DAVID SEYMOUR,2025
Does he stand by all his Government's statements and actions?,Hon Carmel Sepuloni,2025
"on behalf of the Prime Minister: Yes, and I would particularly like to reference the efforts of our Minister for Children, Karen Chhour, in improving the safety of children in residences. That has come down 14 percent in the last two years. It's the first time that there has been a reduction of harm to children in State care, as we understand it, in the country's history. That is really quite an achievement, and a poignant one in the wake of the royal commission, which laid bare the history of brutality that has affected so many people and damaged them for life. This is very good news, and it has come because of a precise and deliberate set of actions by the Minister to improve the quality of staffing, to require staff to wear uniforms, to crack down on contraband\'97for example, by requiring staff to have clear bags so that they couldn't smuggle contraband in\'97and by proactively managing behaviour in the sites. All of this has led to a 14 percent reduction in young people being harmed. That is really fixing what matters and is a good example of what the Labour Party should be thinking about.",Hon DAVID SEYMOUR,2025
"Does he stand by his statement ""We're ready to meet with the unions at any time.""; if so, why is Fire and Emergency New Zealand refusing to turn up to scheduled bargaining with the Professional Firefighters Union?",Hon Carmel Sepuloni,2025
"I certainly do stand by that statement, and I understand that, within 10 minutes of me answering a question on behalf of another Minister yesterday, the Professional Firefighters Union got back in touch, wanting\'97",Hon DAVID SEYMOUR,2025
You corrected it\'97you corrected yourself.,Hon Peeni Henare,2025
"I did. Actually, I was so effective at answering the question, praising these backbone firefighters, that they decided they did want to come back to the table 10 minutes after I answered the question. That's very effective question answering, I have to say.",Hon DAVID SEYMOUR,2025
Why do Government board members deserve an 80 percent pay rise while teachers get an effective pay cut?,Hon Carmel Sepuloni,2025
"The Government's intention is that when we have serious large assets\'97for example, I refer to Pharmac; that is something that spends $2 billion a year, nearly, on medicines for sick New Zealanders. Now, we want to ensure that the governance\'97the board of that agency\'97are paid at a rate that is at least almost comparable to what the same directors would get for private sector companies. There's a real contradiction for the Labour Party here: they want the State to do more, they want more Government agencies to do more stuff\'97to invest in video games, to start sovereign wealth funds\'97and yet they don't want to pay the people directing these proposed entities, or even the current ones, even nearly as much as directors get in the private sector. That had to be rectified. In relation to teachers, in the last three years, there has been a 14.5 percent increase in pay for teachers. That is a lot more than many of the New Zealanders who are paying the taxes, making arrangements today around the strikes to have someone look after their kids\'97it's a lot more than they've got lately. For that reason, the Government needs to balance the interests of Kiwis. There needs to be a sense of realism and a connection between those who are paying the taxes and those who are receiving money from the taxpayer.",Hon DAVID SEYMOUR,2025
Why do tobacco companies deserve $300 million while nurses are being offered an effective pay cut?,Hon Carmel Sepuloni,2025
"It is simply a mischaracterisation for the Labour Party to say that tobacco companies have been given $300 million. That simply has not happened. What the Government has done is say that if there is a nicotine-based product that is safer, that has less impact on people's health, and has less impact on the health system, then it should be taxed in proportion to the amount of harm done. Now, the Opposition know this because, when they were in Government, they said there should be zero tax on vapes, because they too subscribed to the principle\'97although the problem is that they don't know it, because they wouldn't know a principle if they tripped over one.",Hon DAVID SEYMOUR,2025
"Why is he willing to spend $44,000 on a helicopter trip for his Instagram\'97the equivalent of nine months' base salary for the firefighters he is offering an effective pay cut to?",Hon Carmel Sepuloni,2025
"On behalf of the Prime Minister, this is the problem. You see, the relationship between New Zealand and Australia is one of the most, if not the most, important relationships between two countries anywhere in the world. That's why we have a meeting and actually invest in our relationship between the New Zealand Prime Minister and the Australian Prime Minister. But the Labour Party says it was for Instagram. You see, that's why they think people do politics\'97for Instagram\'97and that is the problem with the Labour Party today. That is why they're over there, and we adults are over here.",Hon DAVID SEYMOUR,2025
"Should New Zealand workers, doctors, nurses, teachers, and firefighters accept a pay rise below inflation; yes or no?",Hon Carmel Sepuloni,2025
"The Speaker will tell you that you cannot demand yes or no answers. The simple fact is that this Government is balancing the needs of New Zealanders as patients, as taxpayers, and as public health workers. We have to balance all of these, and the offers that have been put on the table are designed to do that\'97to bring people together and connect the needs and the means of New Zealanders with the demands and the pressures from union organisers.",Hon DAVID SEYMOUR,2025
"How can he complain about doctors, firefighters, nurses, and teachers unions not acting in good faith when he is threatening to limit their ability to strike because they won't settle for pay rises that don't even match inflation?",Hon Carmel Sepuloni,2025
"Yesterday, the Prime Minister was asked about this precise matter and said he was not aware that that's what the Government is doing. So, again, this is misinformation from the Opposition.",Hon DAVID SEYMOUR,2025
"Why is he not willing to negotiate with teachers, firefighters, and nurses about fair pay but is willing to negotiate a rates rebate on his $10.5 million mansion?",Hon Carmel Sepuloni,2025
"A couple of things about that: first of all, the Prime Minister is absolutely willing to negotiate with the unions. In fact, the Government has been saying, through the Public Service Commission, that we are prepared to meet and work through the weekend to get a deal to avoid these strikes. The Government is here making the offers, trying to get the Public Service back to work in order for people to be served and we can make a balanced Budget on behalf of New Zealanders for all of our economic future. Now, on the comment about the Prime Minister's personal capacity and his personal residence, there's no responsibility for that except to say that there is a tone that if someone's worked hard all their life and done well, they should be dragged down and they should be embarrassed about their success and having a nice place on Waiheke. Well, actually, on this side of the House we say that success is a good thing and tall poppy is bad.",Hon DAVID SEYMOUR,2025
"I'll just make the point that bringing members' personal circumstances into the House has not been encouraged in the past, and there are any number of reasons why that would be the case, certainly not the least of which is that we come here to represent constituents and not necessarily attack each other.",SPEAKER,2025
What recent reports has she seen on the economy?,Suze Redmayne,2025
"On Tuesday, Stats NZ released the latest monthly trade figures, which cover imports and exports of goods. This data release shows how well New Zealand's exporters are performing. Seasonally adjusted export values were up 0.9 percent in September, following increases of 7 percent in August and 2.2 percent in July. Taking an annual view, in the year to September export values were up 13.5 percent over the previous year. This, of course, reflects the hard work of Kiwis employed across exporting sectors, which support one in four jobs.",Hon NICOLA WILLIS,2025
What types of exports have been doing well?,Suze Redmayne,2025
New Zealanders going to Aussie.,Hon Willow-Jean Prime,2025
"Dairy, meat, fruit, and wood together make up over half of New Zealand's goods exports, and these figures are something to celebrate even though Willow-Jean Prime seems to disagree. New Zealand has a well deserved reputation for safe, high-quality food and fibre, and in the year to September dairy exports were up 23 percent compared to the same period last year. Meat exports were up 18 percent, fruit up 33 percent, and wood up 8 percent. Stats NZ notes that a stand-out performer is kiwifruit, now a $4.5 billion a year industry, up from $2.6 billion just two years ago. That is a powerful example of innovation, productivity, and global demand delivering real value for New Zealand.",Hon NICOLA WILLIS,2025
Which export markets have seen an increase?,Suze Redmayne,2025
"Well, export values have risen across almost all of New Zealand's overseas markets. In the year to September, goods exports to China increased 15 percent, those to Australia increased 10 percent compared to same period a year ago, and despite higher tariffs New Zealand's goods exports to the United States continue to grow.

What does this mean for New Zealand's trade balance?,Suze Redmayne,2025
"For the past 30 years, New Zealand has typically recorded an annual goods trade deficit\'97that is, we import more than we export. This deficit reached its highest levels in 2022 and 2023, peaking at a whopping $17 billion. Since then, it has narrowed considerably. This week's data shows an annual trade deficit of only $2 billion. That improvement is flowing through to the balance of payments. The current account deficit was a record 9 percent in the year to December 2022. It is now down to 3.7 percent in the year to June 2025, and further improvement is expected in the September quarter, driven by continuing strong growth in exports. It's always a good day to thank the farmers.",Hon NICOLA WILLIS,2025
What is the Government doing to support the export industry?,Suze Redmayne,2025
"The Government is doing a lot to help that sector, including with a very ambitious trade agenda. Since coming into Government, we have concluded a trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council; concluded, signed, and entered into force a trade agreement with the United Arab Emirates; expedited early entry into force of the agreement with the European Union; launched formal negotiations with India; and we are pursuing new opportunities across South-east Asia. New Zealand makes things the world wants to buy, and the Government will keep backing hard-working Kiwi exporters.",Hon NICOLA WILLIS,2025

"Well, no. What I have been very clear on is the fact that we have been backing our amazing teachers for the last 18 months with the incredible amount of resource that we have been delivering straight to the front line. The three-quarters of a billion dollars of learning support that they so desperately have been asking for. The pathways to principalship, which we have recently announced. The fact that we are paying their teacher registration fees. The professional learning and development opportunities that we have been giving them over the last 18 months\'97tens of millions of dollars' worth. We have been at the table; we have delivered good pay offers. But it's a shame that one of the unions hasn't even bothered to take it to their members.

"Thank you, Madam Chair; I'm out of practice. I just wanted to make a brief call on Part 1 of the bill, basically to say that it's important and correct and right that these four pieces of legislation be brought together into one new piece of legislation. The only other point that I would make\'97and it will become relevant later on in the debate\'97is that it does not include the Official Information Act. Why I say that is because several submitters made submissions on the Official Information Act to bring Parliament's information under that as well. Those were deemed, by the committee, to be out of scope of this bill. That's my brief introduction, Madam Chair. Thank you for the opportunity.",Rt Hon ADRIAN RURAWHE,2025
"Kia ora, Madam Chair. As we begin the committee stage of this bill, I do look at Part 1 and the purpose, clause 3. As it says currently, ""The purpose of this Act is to consolidate and modernise the law about operating and administering Parliament."" The reason I'd be interested in the Minister making a contribution is just for the public to understand what this is about, because I very much think this bill is about this place and about the people in this place and how it's funded, and the goings-on. We don't want to labour the committee stage, but we do want to be seen to actually prosecute and to ask some questions to give confidence to the public so that they understand what this bill is about\'97and it's not just for us as MPs finding a way, I guess, to feather our nest or to make it easy for us, but it's to help make the system better.",GLEN BENNETT,2025
"Thank you, Madam Chair. This is an important bill. I thank members of the Opposition, and others, for their constructive engagement on this. We had a special select committee on this, which, I think, as duly appropriate, it was well chaired by former Speaker the Rt Hon Adrian Rurawhe\'97and thank you for his contribution. This is an important piece of legislation and probably one that's a little bit overdue and one that past Governments and past parliaments have looked at. It brings together the Clerk of the House of Representatives Act 1988, the Parliamentary Service Act 2000, the Members of Parliament (Remuneration and Services) Act 2013, and the Parliamentary Privilege Act 2014. There are a couple of things going on there. One is that if you want to understand how Parliament operates and how it's funded and what its powers are and all of the legislation to do with Parliament, there isn't one place to find it; you've got to go and look at those four Acts. This, if it becomes law and the House approves it, will become the Parliament Act 2025 and it will be the one place. Now, people might say, ""Well, bringing together legislation, that doesn't really seem like much of a deal."", but, actually, it's important to the rule of law and cogency of the statute book that we don't have random pieces of legislation that do different things but all actually relate to the same topic\'97or, in this case, relate to the same institutions: the very important home of our democracy. The second thing is that some of these statutes are quite out of date. The last time we went through a serious round of kind of parliamentary reform was actually in Sir Geoffrey Palmer's day, that great reform period of 1987 through 1990\'97a bit controversial, in some respects, for some, but, from a parliamentary point of view, quite a lot was done by Sir Geoffrey back then, as Attorney-General and Minister of Justice and Leader of the House, to create, essentially, the modern-day foundations of the Parliament: the select committee system, for example. But the Clerk of the House of Representatives got its own Act back in 1988 during that period. The Parliamentary Services Act 2000 is now 25 years old, as well. So it is about modernising this legislation. In relation to the Parliamentary Privilege Act, Parliament went through an exercise soon after I became an MP\'97or it might have been contemporaneously when I became the MP\'97about responding to the judgment of Attorney-General v Leigh, from memory, and there was another case as well in which it became, without boring the committee, really clear that Parliament had to reassert the traditional privileges that exist for all members of this House around freedom of speech and put into statute some common law rights that have, perhaps, at least arguably, contestably at law didn't exist or we needed to make clear that they did exist. So the Parliamentary Privilege Act was a response to court judgments and now it's going to be a part of the Parliament Act. There are some important changes that the Parliament Bill, this bill, makes in relation to parliamentary security, which, no doubt, we'll get to. It also, importantly, changes the funding model, and, in particular, it gives Parliament more independence from the executive in relation to the funding of Parliament. In our Westminster system, with our fused executive and legislature, by definition, the Government governs and controls the Budget, but, actually, Parliament is its own separate institution. There's always been a natural tension there\'97which, actually, to be honest, you can't get rid of entirely\'97between the operation of the funding of Parliament, the legislature, its own institution, and the executive, which, by definition, is only the executive because it has control of the Parliament; if that wasn't the case, they wouldn't be the executive. So what this bill does is put in place a more independent process in which the House is in charge of its own budgets, there is some involvement of the executive but it's a step forward from the status quo where I think most people would say it's more biased towards the Government. That hasn't really been a problem, to be honest\'97I hope both sides of the House would agree",Hon CHRIS BISHOP,2025
"Kia ora, Madam Chair. Clause 52 is around the ""House of Representatives may add \'85 to parliamentary precincts"". Obviously, we have the current precinct where it's at\'97well, the three buildings, and buildings that are currently being built. I just want to seek clarification that this, obviously, is around\'97I mean, the initial purchase of the land back in 1867, or whenever it was, can be dubious, in many ways. I'm just wanting to seek clarification from the Minister that whenever we talk about adding land to the parliamentary precinct, this, obviously, will be in a way that fits in with current laws and isn't about acquiring land, but is around doing right by modern laws. Also, the ability for members or the Business Committee to look at what the parliamentary precinct is: does that fit into the space in terms of whether Parliament is able to not just purchase more land, but actually add to the precinct? For example, Defence House, behind us, is becoming part of the precinct. I just want to clarify that that obviously all sits quite clearly and making sure that however land is acquired in the future, it is done in a way that honours current laws and honours our commitment to the Treaty.",GLEN BENNETT,2025
"Just in relation to a couple of comments made, they're both really important points. Mr Rurawhe talks about the Deputy Speaker; that is a really important point in Part 3 of this bill. The Parliamentary Service Act 2000 makes it clear that the Deputy Speaker can have the functions and powers of the Speaker, but it's unclear in the Clerk of the House of Representatives Act 1988. This goes back to the starting point, which is that the Act was written in 1988 and needs updating. So this makes it crystal clear that the Deputy Speaker can exercise the functions of the Speaker. In relation to Glen Bennett's point around clause 52, this is a bit of a carry-over provision, but it makes it clear that the ""parliamentary precincts"" in clause 53 are Parliament buildings, including the very important executive wing, of course, and Part 1 of Schedule 2 and Part 2 of Schedule 2 have the indicative map of the land. The key point is that there's flexibility for Parliament in the future if it chooses to grow and expand. In fact, there's a process under way around that at the moment, but it just gives some flexibility so that, by resolution, the House can expand the grounds without having to go through a legislative change, because being on the parliamentary grounds has a particular meaning for Parliament, not the least of which is leave. And before any honourable member asks: yes, there would be the ability to extend that to places of ill repute near Parliament, but there is no current proposal on the table to do that and, I hasten to add, for everyone listening, the Government is not intending to do that.",Hon CHRIS BISHOP,2025
"I believe I'm on the right part now, Madam Chair. I just want to draw the Minister's attention to clause 55. It talks about the Speaker controlling and administering the parliamentary precincts. It talks specifically about the powers that are vested in the Speaker, and then it kind of self-refers, in subclause (2), to subclause (1), but it's pretty unclear about what the precincts mean. I'm thinking of a specific example here. For example, is it the Minister's view that the Speaker has authority and powers under this legislation to direct and control members of various workforces, such as security guards, the parliamentary colleagues or staff working with MPs, and the press gallery? I'm thinking about examples where there could be events happening on the forecourt and members of Parliament might want their EAs and others present. Can the Speaker, under the legislation as it's currently worded, make an order to remove the press gallery, for example, or to require staff to go back inside? The reason I raise this is that, in some of those situations, members of Parliament could feel quite insecure given the volatility at the moment around public protest and polarised views, and parliamentary members may not want to venture on to the forecourt if they don't feel they have adequate support from staff. Equally there is a duty for the fourth estate, the media, in this place to make sure that everything here happens transparently, and it is of great public interest when there are large crowds on the forecourt. I'm not challenging anything that has happened over recent times; it may well be that that is the Minister's understanding, but I question whether the legislation as it's currently worded actually does make that explicit, and whether, if that is his view and if it was the will of the committee, it should be added. If it was not the will of the committee or if there were not public submissions on these very important points, my view would be that the legislation should be read at face value, and that the clarification should be made via an amendment or we should have it on the record what actually the committee came to conclude here. These are not entirely hypothetical situations, which is why I am raising them very respectfully, but I do think that the public interest, the media interest, and also the personal views of MPs when it comes to staff and resourcing and support need to be considered when we're looking at the boundaries that relate to clause 55, which really does confer an awful lot of power on the Speaker, or vested in the Speaker, as is right to have that power, but I think the boundaries need to be extremely clear so that, in those situations, everybody is comfortable and clear about what the rules are, and when they could decline or not follow a direction and when they are required to under this legislation.",INGRID LEARY,2025
"Hopefully I can be helpful on that particular question. It's actually a question I asked at select committee. What we need to remember is that under the new set of rules and under this new legislation, which we'll talk about in Part 7, there's a clear monitoring role and reporting role and the direct reporting is with the CEO of Parliamentary Service. The Speaker of the House has overall authority but doesn't actually carry it out himself or herself. And so it's really important that we recognise that the parliamentary security will be operating in a very professional way under clear rules, and, in fact, the regime for reporting such incidents, and carrying that out, is at arm's length from the Speaker of the",Rt Hon ADRIAN RURAWHE,2025
"The member makes good points, but if I could summarise what is reasonable, the answer is: it depends. That's the beauty of the word ""reasonable"", and it's why it appears multiple times in the statute books and throughout the common law, because what is reasonable in the circumstances is fact specific, and it's impossible, by definition almost, to give a definition. If that makes\'97yeah, for me it works. Historically, the common law has talked about ""the man on the Clapham omnibus"", it's probably inapplicable to New Zealand\'97the Karori trolleybus or electric bus these days\'97what that person thinks is reasonable is the test, and it depends. The short answer is it depends. It's impossible to judge in advance. Yes, it is true that people have to make decisions. That's life. What's important is that there are guard rails and tram lines in place to guide that decision-making process and then, also, that there are checks and balances afterwards. In relation to the other point the member makes, parliamentary service officers can exercise powers only in the parliamentary precinct, a place where select committees are meeting, electorate offices where the chief executive has authorised it.",Hon CHRIS BISHOP,2025

"The House has chosen to set aside an hour of its time to debate energy issues, something that says it's a serious issue for this country, something we really need to work on, hopefully, in many ways, in a bipartisan way, because there is much that we can agree on in the energy space. What I want to do, however, is to take this debate first back to defining what some of the issues are in the energy space. When I say to think about it, I thought, well, here are the three broad areas of concern around energy in New Zealand. The first is around supply\'97sufficiency and certainty of supply\'97the second is around pricing, and the third is around climate. So let me just talk through each of those issues and why they are a particular concern for us. I'll start with supply and certainty of supply. Of course, what has been affecting the country today does point to that in some regards. So we know that right at the moment around about 90,000 households are without power. I don't know how many businesses are without power, but, given that many households are out, so many businesses will be too. I heard there's some quite big outages in Southland. There must be some farmers there who are a bit worried about milking and how that's going to happen. Of course, the outages today have been caused by the massive storm through the country. I'm sure that the thoughts of everyone in this House are with the people who are affected directly by the storm and with the workers who are out there trying to get the power back on\'97I know they'll be working hard out there. But that certainty of supply can",Hon Dr DEBORAH RUSSELL,2025
