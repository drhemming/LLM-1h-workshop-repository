"Here they go again! More money from less! That is good. Yes, I did not get more than an extra $68,000 for animal welfare. What I did get was $700 million for an agricultural research and development project. The member says what about the $68,000, and forgets about the $700 million. It is a bit like the biblical quote about seeing the splinter in somebody else’s eye but ignoring the beam in one’s own! In addition, we gave the Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) $300,000. We got $23.3 million in the Budget for a National Animal Identification and Tracing system, which will protect our agricultural sector from being blocked out of important markets all around the world. I am sorry that we got only $700 million, plus $23 million, plus $300,000, and missed out in getting only an extra $68,000 for animal welfare! I think it very unlikely that Mr Carter will ever get anywhere near the Cabinet table again, because even his own colleagues must be underwhelmed by the kind of question he asks in this House.",Hon JIM ANDERTON,2008
"ack to welfare! Following the serious drought of last summer and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry’s saying in this week’s New Zealand Farmers Weekly that some livestock are currently “heading towards starvation”, what responsibility does the Minister take for the massive under-resourcing of a core role of his ministry?",Hon David Carter,2008
"So despite all the extra funding and this Government’s so-called commitment to health, we still have patients who are being turned away at Waitakere Hospital, and how does she expect the hospital to fulfil its goal of providing a 24/7 service when currently it cannot even stay open between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m.?",Paula Bennett,2008
"I say to the Minister in the chair that he owes an apology to the people of M_pua for the botched clean-up. The Minister owes an explanation as to why the advice of the local council, the local authority, was ignored when it advised that the consent conditions should be complied with. They need to provide an explanation as to why more than 5 tonnes of copper sulphate, without a consent, was used in the clean-up process. An explanation needs to be provided to the local residents who wrote to the Minister and said they were getting sick. There were doctors’ reports of people getting sick, and the ministry ignored them. I say that M_pua is another sad chapter in the environmental failure record of this Government.",Hon Dr NICK SMITH,2008
"If there is one person who should be apologising for the M_pua clean-up, it is the former member for Tasman, Nick Smith. He is the person who put inordinate pressure on the local council to get it moving. He is the person who put inordinate pressure on it to set up a scheme with conditions.",Hon TREVOR MALLARD,2008
"I have to say that when the Employment Relations (Probationary Employment) Amendment Bill was introduced, Mr Little debated the issue quite responsibly, and was quite considered and deliberate. But now that we are much closer to an election, and his union has been registered as supporting Labour—that is why it has been registered; for being an affiliate of the Labour Party—panic has set in. Extravagant language is being used by him.",Dr WAYNE MAPP,2008
"We now know the words that Crosby/Textor has given to the National Party to use for its industrial relations policy—“fair and reasonable”. How many times did Dr Mapp feel forced to say those words in that 5-minute speech—that tirade about how terrible things are in industrial relations here in New Zealand. Well, look—all New Zealanders know, I tell Dr Mapp, that peace has broken out in industrial relations in New Zealand under Labour. Not only have we had the most peaceful workplaces we have had for a long time in this country under Labour, and the fairest workplaces we have had for a long time, but we have also managed to bring the unemployment rate down to the second lowest in the OECD. ",SUE MORONEY,2008
" am delighted to have the opportunity to take a call on the community and voluntary sector part of this debate, because it is an opportunity to pay tribute to the 75 percent of New Zealanders who say that they volunteer in our communities in one way or another. There are 97,000 community organisations operating in New Zealand. If it were an Olympics, we would win gold medals for setting up and operating community organisations—97,000 of those organisations, run entirely by volunteers. That is a huge commitment from New Zealand citizens to supporting their community in one way or another, and I do not think it is something this Committee should take for granted. I think it is something we should respect and value, and we should ensure that our central government policies work alongside those people in our community who give so much of their time, their energy, and, often, their money—either through lost opportunity or through direct giving. This debate is a very good opportunity to pay that respect.",Hon RUTH DYSON ,2008
"I guess Dr Smith must be a doctor of philosophy, not a doctor of medicine; otherwise he would not be making such a fool of himself.",Hon DAVID CUNLIFFE,2008
"This is the most vulnerable time in these women’s lives. Can members imagine being diagnosed with the most aggressive form of breast cancer and being told that 12 months of treatment is the better course, but they can be given only 9 weeks? They want to live—boy, do they want to live. ",Dr JACKIE BLUE,2008
"The member is getting desperate now. He simply cannot have it both ways. Either the Government has failed to invest or we have invested too much, depending on which day of the week one takes his questions. He is arguing from both sides of that street. The Government has roughly doubled the investment in public health care. It has built a record number of new facilities. It has invested in the health workforce. It has developed a primary-care strategy, and it has upgraded technologies throughout the system. There is a systematic upgrade occurring of New Zealand’s public health care, and the member knows New Zealanders have better, more affordable, more accessible health care as a result of it.",Hon DAVID CUNLIFFE,2008
"Does the Government have any longer-term strategies in Auckland to ensure that there are more spaces available in quality rehabilitation units—at the moment there is only one—and that there is sufficient step-down accommodation, community support, and accommodation services for patients such as the gentleman who was recently released in these circumstances?",Sue Bradford,2008
"In light of the fact that oil price shocks have not been considered in any of the business cases, does he accept that an oil price shock would reduce the benefits in the business cases for building those motorways and would also increase the construction costs\'97so an oil price shock would change the benefit to cost ratio by reducing the benefits and increasing the costs?",Dr Russel Norman,2010
"In some respects, it is fairly obvious that if the prices were different, the business case would look a bit different. But the lesson from past surges in oil prices is that although people may change to more efficient cars or different types of fuel, the private car is likely to remain a vastly dominant form of transport, no matter how much we spend on railways. If the dominant form is not cars, then it is buses, and they still need roads.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
"In the light of an oil price shock, does he think that the benefit-cost ratio would look better for a new motorway project or a new rail project, and hence, that if he included oil price shocks in the studies of the benefit to cost for these two projects, actually rail would look much better, in the case of an oil price shock, than new motorways?",Dr Russel Norman,2010
"I have not personally done those calculations, but my guess is that we would need to have a very high oil price to make the cost-benefit ratio on rail look better. If the oil price was high, we would have to presume most people would shift to rail, but even if the volumes on rail doubled or trebled, the economics of it are still very marginal.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
"What did he mean when he also said on 18 December 2008, after the election and after the global financial crisis had hit, that ""In New Zealand we have room to respond. This is the rainy day the Government has been saving up for.""; and did it relate to the previous Government paying off debt, even when criticised by him for doing so?",Hon Annette King,2010
"Was the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Alan Bollard, correct when he said in 2008 that New Zealand has ""enjoyed a decade of growth, the longest period of economic growth since post World War II era. Inflation has been low, averaging 2.2 percent since 1998.""; if not, why does he believe that Dr Bollard is correct now when he says that inflation would be around 2 percent in 2012-13?",Hon Annette King,2010
"Yes. The Government is investing billions of dollars into strengthening the national electricity grid, setting out to roll broadband out across the country, plus putting very heavy investments into roading and rail. These will both increase the resilience of our economy and underpin stronger growth in the future.",Hon BILL ENGLISH,2010
"Regarding the intention of the Government to pursue the Rugby World Cup 2011 (Empowering) Bill, I wonder whether the acting Leader of the House could tell us whether the Government has had a chance to consider the amendments promoted by Mr Mallard to temper some of the sweeping powers available to the Minister for the Rugby World Cup under that legislation, to ensure that the bill can return to being a bipartisan bill, which it has been up until this point. I know that Mr Mallard put those amendments on the Table, and if the Committee stage will take place next week that information would assist the Opposition in its planning as to whether it can cooperate with the Government on that measure.",Hon DARREN HUGHES,2010
"Was the Minister, in making his statement on 18 December 2008, concerned at the huge surge in public spending, from 29 percent of GDP to 34.7 percent of GDP, that occurred between 2004 and 2008 as the Labour Government abandoned all fiscal restraint; if so, what measures are being taken to wind back spending?",Hon Sir Roger Douglas,2010
Has the Government estimated the cost to the taxpayer of the interest rate premium the Government is paying as a result of the Minister's loss of credibility as Minister of Finance because of his housing scandal?,Hon Trevor Mallard,2010
"T\uc0\u275 n\u257  koe, Mr Speaker. Kia ora t\u257 tou. Does he agree that the country's current measurement of economic progress, GDP, is highly susceptible to these economic shocks, and what will he do to progress the implementation of the genuine progress index, which, as a more holistic measure of economic progress, would be less susceptible to economic shocks?",Te Ururoa Flavell,2010
"behalf of the Minister of Finance: No, I do not agree with that. The Meridian Energy float is, in fact, by value the largest retail investment in an internal public offering in New Zealand’s history. The 62,000 shareholders mean that Meridian Energy will have the third-largest share register of all the companies on the NZX when it lists next week. The share float will provide $1.9 billion in cash for the Government, which we can invest in other public assets without having to borrow. It will be 86.5 percent New Zealand - owned when it lists, comfortably meeting the Government’s target of 85 percent local ownership. And, finally, the 250,000 figure that the member quotes was not a forecast.",Hon STEVEN JOYCE,2013
"Will he now accept that his asset sales programme has failed to achieve his goal of widespread public ownership, when only 1 percent of New Zealanders bought into Meridian Energy and the other 99 percent of New Zealanders did not, because they are finding it hard enough to pay the power bill let alone buy a power company?",Dr RUSSEL NORMAN,2013
"What impact does he expect loan-to-value ratios to have on the Government’s housing policy, which claims to be focused on trying to increase supply, if, as Warwick Quinn of the Registered Master Builders Federation predicts, they result in 3,000 fewer new homes being built each year?",Phil Twyford,2013
"hat is a difficult statement to reconcile with a statement made by the Registered Master Builders Federation to the Minister’s colleague the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment at around the same time, when it said it was worried there would not be enough apprentices and enough people with skills to actually build all the houses. So I think we need to rationalise where we are at here: either there are not enough people around to build all the houses or there are not enough houses going to be built. I am sure we will resolve that situation",Hon STEVEN JOYCE,2013
"As the Chief of Defence Force told the member at the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee on 6 December 2012 and also on 22 June 2013, the New Zealand Defence Force has had no cut in capabilities. The member is also working with out-of-date statistics. The New Zealand Defence Force attrition rate today is 14 percent, which is below the historic long-run average and well below the 19 percent figure under Labour. Both army and navy attrition rates today are significantly beneath levels reached under Labour.",Hon Dr JONATHAN COLEMAN,2013
"When the navy admits that skill and experience levels in critical trade groups have been seriously degraded—their words, Minister—by the significant reduction in the number of trained personnel available, why does he keep on pretending that this has not reduced the navy’s capability?",Hon Phil Goff:,2013
"My answer is that unlike what happened under the last Labour Government, I have made sure that every single forestry operation in this country is being visited, with a view to holding investigations where there are unacceptable practices. As I say, those investigations may well lead to prosecutions and have already led to some of those companies being stopped in their tracks and having business stopped",Hon SIMON BRIDGES,2013
"Today I have announced an additional $9 million over 4 years to support rural general practices to retain clinical staff and services. This new investment is on top of the $13 million a year already funded for rural general practice support. This additional funding will take effect from 1 July 2014, when a new way of allocating rural funding will be rolled out",Hon JO GOODHEW ,2013
"Is the Minister saying to the people of New Zealand that his job is not to read a very important environment report from the very company that had a 25 percent stake in the Gulf of Mexico spill; and how sensible, safe, and environmentally responsible is it to allow Anadarko to drill a well in the deepest water just off the Waikato coast, and not even need a marine consent, when people in the Waikato need a resource consent to drill a water bore?",Gareth Hughes,2013
"The Policing Act 2008 was quite different. I want to refer to section 22 of the Policing Act 2008, which says: “A Police employee may become a constable only by taking the constable’s oath, in either of the following forms, before the Commissioner or a person authorised by the Commissioner to administer the constable’s oath:”. That was the change that was made in 2008. It was recognised, however, in October of 2009 that that Act was not being appropriately administered, and that was essentially because people who were not correctly authorised had continued to act in the way that they had under the old law.",JACINDA ARDERN ,2013
"In relation to where it is an accurate quote from me, yes, I have said in this House that as we have seen the number of young people on benefits drop, we have refined the numbers of young people who are suitable to go into that course.",Hon ANNE TOLLEY,2015
"How can she guarantee that demand for Limited Service Volunteer programme places has actually reduced when she has admitted that the Ministry of Social Development does not even report on the number of applications for the course and she is just relying on the fact that ""the likely number of young people at long-term risk of unemployment has reduced.""",Darroch Ball,2015
"I rely on advice from officials who are working with these young people every day. If the need arises and the demand increases, then we will have a look at it again.",Hon ANNE TOLLEY,2015
"If she honestly believes in a direct, evidence-based approach, then how can she prove that only 800 out of 25,000 unemployed youth are suitable for this course?",Darroch Ball,2015
"Is it correct that according to Statistics New Zealand figures, real seasonally adjusted GDP per capita growth in the first 6 months of this year was the worst it has been since 2010?",GRANT ROBERTSON,2015
"Can the Minister confirm that the first 6 months of this year saw a 0.2 percent negative GDP per capita growth, and is this reflective of a successful economy?",Grant Robertson,2015
"Sorry, I do not have that at the top of my notes here and cannot remember the exact figure, but what I would say is that, actually, one of our highest rates of labour force participation actually shows confidence in the numbers of those who are actually in the workforce and looking.",Hon PAULA BENNETT,2015
"How can the Minister judge the economy a success, when we are on an international watch-list of concern, housing is the most unaffordable that it has been in 60 years, exports as a percentage of GDP are the lowest since 1997, and, to help the Minister out, 148,000 New Zealanders are unemployed?",Grant Robertson,2015
"I know that that member is making a career out of trying to talk down our economy, and actually does not have the view that we are growing, that we are sustainable. We are still looking at GDP growth of around 2 percent, which actually is considered low risk. They cannot actually get it together enough to recognise the benefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will grow us beyond just that Chinese market and see other sectors, apart from dairy, also growing.",Hon PAULA BENNETT,2015
How is the Government's economic plan managing the challenges presented by low inflation and the outlook for the global economy?,PAUL FOSTER-BELL,2015
"Does she stand by her statement in relation to the army-run Limited Service Volunteer programme that ""as the total number of young people on benefits drops, so too does the number of suitable clients who are likely to benefit from attending the LSV programme."";?",Darroch Ball,2015
I rise to pass a few comments and a few thanks at the end of my 7 years as a member of this Parliament and 9 years as co-leader of the Green Party. I want to start with a little story from Queensland. Some of you may know that I was born in Brisbane...,Dr RUSSEL NORMAN,2015
"How is it a sign of success for the New Zealand economy that we have now been added to HSBC's watch-list of nations that it has a concern about due to our overreliance on China, falling commodity prices, and the Auckland housing bubble?",Grant Robertson,2015
"As I said, I rely on advice from the officials and, also, from those who are working with young people on a daily basis. We are conducting those courses, we are paying for those courses, and they are having a great effect on the young people involved.",Hon ANNE TOLLEY,2015
"Next week the House is in a 1-week adjournment. When the House resumes on Tuesday, 3 November, the Government will look to advance a number of bills on the Order Paper, including the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Bill and the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015-16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill. As agreed by the Business Committee, extended hours will be taken on the morning of Wednesday, 4 November for Government business, and, as indicated yesterday, the House will rise at approximately 5.45 p.m. or at the conclusion of the new Green Party member's speech.",Hon GERRY BROWNLEE,2015
"Yes, but annual GDP growth between June 2014 and June 2015 was actually 2.4 percent, and, as I say, most commentators would take it from an annual GDP per capita basis, and we are very confident that this actual calendar year will also see a growth.",Hon PAULA BENNETT,2015
"Like many New Zealand households, the Government has weekly obligations that it must meet and finances to balance. By analogy, if the Government were the average New Zealand household it would have had an income last year of $90,900, expenses of $90,500, and a $400 surplus at the year end. This Government household would have debt of $76,000 and it would be paying $59 per week in interest. So we are reasonably well positioned to weather future uncertainties. What is important is that we continue to work towards paying down that debt while continuing to meet our commitments to New Zealanders.",Hon PAULA BENNETT,2015
"Are chirping birds in the neighbours' trees a truly representative reason some people are turning down State houses, or is the real reason that cold, damp, mouldy houses are making their children sick?",Phil Twyford,2015
": Again, holding up a chart like that is actually rather sad because what that chart represented yesterday was the highest house-building rate in this country since 1973. This fantastic news that should be celebrated has been‚Äîlike the No. 1 lemon suckers in the country‚Äîturned around now to a chart about gangs. The problem is that we have got ourselves ready to deal to the gangs in this country. We've changed the laws, and there are laws we have changed with respect to the use of guns, which, dare I say it, is being supported over here, but not by them. So let's have a little less of the crocodile tears and a bit of on-the-ground common sense.",Rt Hon WINSTON PETERS,2020
": I want to thank the Minister of Police for reminding us of the fact and not just allegations. But can I just say police will be on the ground. Expect to see more armed police on the streets of Hawke's Bay and the Bay of Plenty in response to this gang tension. Expect to see police openly carrying their rifles and pistols where it's required, expect to see police wearing new body armour, expect to see the Eagle helicopter in the air, and expect to see police executing search warrants at gang properties. Expect them also to be enforcing the new laws that we are about to pass with respect to their gang access or the provisioning of gangs with guns, which that Opposition party there is opposing.",Rt Hon WINSTON PETERS,2020
": I'm aware of a number of concerns that Professor Andrew Geddis has raised by some parties under our Electoral Act, including actions by the National Party funnelling donations to electorate candidates through their party‚Äîincluding to Nick Smith, whose only declared donation in the 2017 election was a $25,000 donation from the National Party. What was he trying to conceal?",Hon ANDREW LITTLE,2020
"SIMON O'CONNOR (National‚ÄîTƒÅmaki) to the Associate Minister of Housing (Public Housing) : Can he confirm that almost 14,500 New Zealanders are currently waiting for a State house, and that the waiting list is more than double what it was when National left office?",SIMON O'CONNOR,2020
"on behalf of the Associate Minister of Housing (Public Housing) : Yes. The Government has always been clear that it is going to take some time to reverse the damage that nine years of neglect caused. Five thousand State houses were removed from the State housing list under the last Government. Since we took office, we've created 4,258 new public housing spaces, and we have a further 3,480 houses under construction. If that rate of progress had been in place over the nine years prior to when we became the Government, we would not have a State house waiting list at all.",Hon CHRIS HIPKINS (Leader of the House),2020
": Rubbish? Somebody who doesn't speak MƒÅori is saying rubbish. Oh, no; that's right. That was the other impressive thing we've done: we've given all the MPs that are there headsets so they can have a simultaneous translation. This is how inclusive we are. Let me tell you now, when the MPs get things together, we set an example for the rest of the country. We spoke about the bridge. We spoke about the bridge that MƒÅori have had to cross since Europeans have been here, the bridge that means that MƒÅori can cross from the MƒÅori world into the European world. We've learnt the language, we've learnt the customs, we've learnt the tikanga, and it's almost always been one-way traffic. What we need and my vision for New Zealand in 2040, the bicentenary of the signing of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, is that by then, PƒÅkehƒÅ, Europeans, will be able to cross that bridge to the other side and know our language and know our customs and know how we think and feel and why we act and behave the way we do, and that New Zealanders can be crossing that bridge freely and communicating in whatever language we decide and we're not talking past each other. So this is my question for Simon Bridges, who in his tone-deaf speech believes that he's a statesman and that he has got some sort of mana and kudos. I'll tell you what, he's so uncomfortable in his MƒÅori skin he seeks affirmation from non-MƒÅori. That's where he gets his affirmation. In the meantime, he tramples on the mana and dignity of NgƒÅpuhi. But here's the thing. I have a question for Simon Bridges: Simon, are you prepared to cross that bridge? Are you prepared to cross? Even though he's MƒÅori, he was born on the non-MƒÅori side of things. Is he prepared to cross that bridge into the MƒÅori side? And I say if he is not prepared to cross that bridge, I question‚Äîand I say this to everybody in this House. If we are not prepared to cross that bridge freely and communicate with the people on the other side, then I question our place as politicians, as parliamentarians. That is the vision that I have for Aotearoa New Zealand: that we can cross that bridge freely.",Hon KELVIN DAVIS,2020
": Could I just say that one of those is because of the deportation policies from Australia. The other is the environment that was allowed to grow that ensured that gangs do thrive in this country, under the previous administration. The third one is the gangs have not got it through their heads that this Government means to deal to that sort of behaviour, because they're used to a party saying, ""The day after the election we'll bulldoze the headquarters down."" They said that and did nothing about it.",Rt Hon WINSTON PETERS,2020
": On behalf of the Prime Minister, that is not known. As to whether there was a partial association, a full association, an intermediary association, or a historical association, that sort of information we don't have. But what we do have‚Äîand very shortly‚Äîis not 1,000 or 1,500, but 2,000 new front-line police being deployed to take on this area. That means boots on the ground, not dinosaur footprints.",Rt Hon WINSTON PETERS,2020
": What would the solution have been from that previous Government? Thirteen of the 16 current polytechs are running deficits; the enrolments have been declining since 2010. I heard someone over there‚ÄîI'm not sure who it was, but they said, ""Oh, you're the Government."" That's right. That's why this side is doing something about it, because by doing nothing, the previous Government had already put vocational training under serious threat‚Äîserious threat. If we as a Government on this side of the House continued to do nothing, we would see the vocational sector go further into decline, and we've already heard the Minister of Education say that he refuses‚Äîhe refuses‚Äîto take that position. Now, this is an exciting bill. This is a day where we are putting vocational education back on the map. I'd have to say that I was actually really delighted‚Äîyou would think, that we had actually sat in different select committee hearings, and I can actually say, even though we split up into subcommittees, that I sat with Dr Reti for most of those same select committee hearings, but you would think that we were listening to different people in those select committee hearings. Most of those 236 submitters, many of them individuals, some organisations, were actually in support of the intent of this bill. Even those organisations and people who wanted to see changes made in the bill, most of those people and organisations were actually fully in support of the intent of this bill. This bill addresses the four challenges with the current system. Our skills shortages across sectors‚Äîwe hear about that a lot, and we heard about that a lot in the submissions during the select committee process. That's the first one. The second one: the untenable split in vocational systems. It was confusing. You had people or organisations that were competing against each other. So this is a bill that will consolidate those particular systems. The inequity of some polytechs doing well and others not‚Äîas I said, we have 13 of the current 16 polytechs that are running deficits; only three that are not running those deficits. There is a huge inequity there. We've been told in this House that, ""Oh, no, maybe we should be looking at this quite differently because there are three that are doing all right."" Well, I don't think it's OK that inequity exists like that. So this is what this bill is addressing. The fourth issue that this bill addresses is the lack of industry input in the current system, and that was something that we heard time and time and time again from industry saying that they want that tidied up. So the select committee did that. Now, I actually want to thank the Education and Workforce Committee, the full committee, in the work that they did. Due to health and my forced absence in the end, I wasn't there for the final deliberations in this bill. But I was very, very glad that I was able to be part of the committee up until that point and hear the many submissions that we heard. I'd have to say that, of all the bills that we've had before us as a select committee, in the Education and Workforce team, I think this is one that we probably put a heck of a lot of diligence into the work that we did. You can see that looking at the departmental report. It is extensive, and the changes that were recommended are ones that the subcommittees went through and deliberated on and talked about, and our officials in those subcommittees were amazing. They were incredible because they came back time and time and time again‚Äîso thanking all those members of the select committee but also the officials, who were so diligent in the work that they did as well. We've heard today that this bill is around modernising the learning of the sector. We're actually starting to look outside the square, looking to the responsive changes in the world. Learning doesn't just have to keep happening the way it's always been because that's the way we've always done it. We need to look at the issues, we need to hear from the sectors, and we need to change up what we're doing to make it better. Now, we heard all of those points that Dr Reti took out and said, ""These won't work."" Well, I challenge Dr Reti that we actually went through as a committee and based these changes on evidence. We based them on evidence of learning and modern learning, and changing up that way of how the world is existing. And we based it on the needs of the sector and what the sector asked us to look at. As Dr Reti rightly pointed out, there are lots and lots of changes that were made from select committee. I've already pointed out that the departmental report is extensive, but a couple that I just want to briefly, briefly touch on, because I know that I've got colleagues here that are touching on the rest, is that a number of submitters expressed support that the workforce development councils be industry owned and led. As I said before, that came through time and time again: industry were really concerned that that had to be a major component. So as a committee we looked at that, and the Minister outlined the changes that we made, but we were responsive to the needs of industry, and those changes can be seen having come through from the select committee process. The other important consideration was the one that Dr Reti talked about right at the end of his contribution‚Äîaround the important consideration given to the concern shown from submitters that industry training organisations (ITO) staff would lose jobs in the transfer of the new system. We heard that we'd taken our eye off the ball. I would actually challenge that because, if you read the original bill as it stood, clause 33 in that bill already had the provisions for the transfer of polytech staff to the NZIST. So it already existed. What we were told, though, was that this didn't cover the transitional ITO transfers, and even though there was the intent that that would happen, under clause 33, it wasn't transparent enough in people's minds. So that was where the changes were made. And, yes, that's a great thing because we now have that protection for those staff members. I have heard from people who are working in the sector who are absolutely delighted at this change, around the surety that it gives them in their positions going forward. So I'm absolutely delighted to see this bill come through to the second reading. I'm delighted to also see the ongoing work that we heard from the Minister about the Supplementary Order Paper that he has expressed will be coming through when this bill gets to the next stage. So, without any further ado, I commend this bill to the House.",JAN TINETTI,2020
": I mean, I know it's the embodiment of me: short and snappy and to that point. Just to start this off with the amazing comment made by the previous speaker, Parmjeet Parmar. Now, it's been recognised that 13 out of 16 of the polytechs, when this Government came into Government, were going to fail. They were failing. They were in deficit. It cost this Government $100 million to keep them open. That's taxpayers' money; $100 million of taxpayers' money because the previous Government and the previous Minister for Tertiary Education‚ÄîI think his name was Steven Joyce‚Äîknew that there was a budgetary hole, and maybe this was part of his budgetary hole because he knew that a hundred million dollars of taxpayers' money would have to be put into the polytechs to keep some regional educational vocation provision. But the previous speaker just blamed it on this Government's policies around international students, who can't now get into the country. I'm going to make a jump‚ÄîI'm going to make a leap‚Äîbut I'm going to say that that speaker is talking about the actions we've taken to protect this nation from coronavirus. That's the only thing I can think of, because with regard to international students, it's been a couple of years and the polytechs were already in deficit before we even came in and we even made any changes. So I think it's an enormous stretch for the chair of the Education and Workforce Committee to then say that the reason why polytechs are in trouble is because of the coronavirus. It's a stretch. I've got to say, it's a stretch. Somebody else might be able to connect that, but it's a wee way out for me. So the other comments that have been made by Shane Reti‚Äîand I like Shane Reti. I enjoy listening to Shane Reti. I mean, there is a man of intelligence and integrity. I believe that to be true. Sometimes he's wrong, but he has intelligence and integrity. Now, what he talked about there was he said that this legislation is rushed. There is a reasonable amount of urgency. Definitely that is true around fixing the vocational education system in this country. One of them is because we can't keep pouring $100 million into a broken system. The three polytechs that actually were making money, even if we talk about their ability to do that locally and regionally‚Äîthe only reason why, for example, the Southern Institute of Technology was able to stay in the black was because not only do they have an amazing community and a wonderful trust down there that supports them but they had a campus in Auckland. So they were not able to actually keep themselves in the black based on their localism; they needed a campus in Auckland. That goes to show that the regional provision was not able to work under the way that it had been set up previously. The other thing I find fascinating‚Äîand I want to thank all those business owners and industry training organisations (ITOs) and MƒÅori enterprise and so on that came to see me specifically so that I could draw them and go through with them where the areas of concern are in the model that we've got here because of the scaremongering put together by the National Party.",Hon TRACEY MARTIN,2020

": The Government's pretty sensitive about it, eh? They don't like a bit of criticism‚Äîshut down the Opposition! Typical of your approach around electoral law when you test this Government on its dodgy carryings-on, whether it be the New Zealand First Foundation or whether it be the provisions of this bill. Here's the issue: the Electoral Commission recommended against same-day enrolment for the 2020 election.

": Can I say, again, Tenby Powell had a call from the Minister of Police this morning‚Äîthat's the first thing. The second thing is he has been assured of the number of people we are putting on the ground and that the police will be provisioned with the utilities to do their job. The third thing is that quote could have been said by me‚Äîit sounds so original.",Rt Hon WINSTON PETERS,2020
": On behalf of the Prime Minister, the police in this country may have had that sentiment at one time, but now there'll be no excuse because they will have the resources. They'll have the men and women and the power on the front line. In contrast, we saw the previous administration run the police numbers down‚Äînot going up; going down‚Äîand if I had that record, I'd keep my mouth shut.",Rt Hon WINSTON PETERS,2020
": I want to thank the Minister of Police for reminding us of the fact and not just allegations. But can I just say police will be on the ground. Expect to see more armed police on the streets of Hawke's Bay and the Bay of Plenty in response to this gang tension. Expect to see police openly carrying their rifles and pistols where it's required, expect to see police wearing new body armour, expect to see the Eagle helicopter in the air, and expect to see police executing search warrants at gang properties. Expect them also to be enforcing the new laws that we are about to pass with respect to their gang access or the provisioning of gangs with guns, which that Opposition party there is opposing.",Rt Hon WINSTON PETERS,2020

"Just in relation to a couple of comments made, they're both really important points. Mr Rurawhe talks about the Deputy Speaker; that is a really important point in Part 3 of this bill. The Parliamentary Service Act 2000 makes it clear that the Deputy Speaker can have the functions and powers of the Speaker, but it's unclear in the Clerk of the House of Representatives Act 1988. This goes back to the starting point, which is that the Act was written in 1988 and needs updating. So this makes it crystal clear that the Deputy Speaker can exercise the functions of the Speaker. In relation to Glen Bennett's point around clause 52, this is a bit of a carry-over provision, but it makes it clear that the ""parliamentary precincts"" in clause 53 are Parliament buildings, including the very important executive wing, of course, and Part 1 of Schedule 2 and Part 2 of Schedule 2 have the indicative map of the land. The key point is that there's flexibility for Parliament in the future if it chooses to grow and expand. In fact, there's a process under way around that at the moment, but it just gives some flexibility so that, by resolution, the House can expand the grounds without having to go through a legislative change, because being on the parliamentary grounds has a particular meaning for Parliament, not the least of which is leave. And before any honourable member asks: yes, there would be the ability to extend that to places of ill repute near Parliament, but there is no current proposal on the table to do that and, I hasten to add, for everyone listening, the Government is not intending to do that.",Hon CHRIS BISHOP,2025
"Thank you, Madam Chair. This is an important bill. I thank members of the Opposition, and others, for their constructive engagement on this. We had a special select committee on this, which, I think, as duly appropriate, it was well chaired by former Speaker the Rt Hon Adrian Rurawhe\'97and thank you for his contribution. This is an important piece of legislation and probably one that's a little bit overdue and one that past Governments and past parliaments have looked at. It brings together the Clerk of the House of Representatives Act 1988, the Parliamentary Service Act 2000, the Members of Parliament (Remuneration and Services) Act 2013, and the Parliamentary Privilege Act 2014. There are a couple of things going on there. One is that if you want to understand how Parliament operates and how it's funded and what its powers are and all of the legislation to do with Parliament, there isn't one place to find it; you've got to go and look at those four Acts. This, if it becomes law and the House approves it, will become the Parliament Act 2025 and it will be the one place. Now, people might say, ""Well, bringing together legislation, that doesn't really seem like much of a deal."", but, actually, it's important to the rule of law and cogency of the statute book that we don't have random pieces of legislation that do different things but all actually relate to the same topic\'97or, in this case, relate to the same institutions: the very important home of our democracy. The second thing is that some of these statutes are quite out of date. The last time we went through a serious round of kind of parliamentary reform was actually in Sir Geoffrey Palmer's day, that great reform period of 1987 through 1990\'97a bit controversial, in some respects, for some, but, from a parliamentary point of view, quite a lot was done by Sir Geoffrey back then, as Attorney-General and Minister of Justice and Leader of the House, to create, essentially, the modern-day foundations of the Parliament: the select committee system, for example. But the Clerk of the House of Representatives got its own Act back in 1988 during that period. The Parliamentary Services Act 2000 is now 25 years old, as well. So it is about modernising this legislation. In relation to the Parliamentary Privilege Act, Parliament went through an exercise soon after I became an MP\'97or it might have been contemporaneously when I became the MP\'97about responding to the judgment of Attorney-General v Leigh, from memory, and there was another case as well in which it became, without boring the committee, really clear that Parliament had to reassert the traditional privileges that exist for all members of this House around freedom of speech and put into statute some common law rights that have, perhaps, at least arguably, contestably at law didn't exist or we needed to make clear that they did exist. So the Parliamentary Privilege Act was a response to court judgments and now it's going to be a part of the Parliament Act. There are some important changes that the Parliament Bill, this bill, makes in relation to parliamentary security, which, no doubt, we'll get to. It also, importantly, changes the funding model, and, in particular, it gives Parliament more independence from the executive in relation to the funding of Parliament. In our Westminster system, with our fused executive and legislature, by definition, the Government governs and controls the Budget, but, actually, Parliament is its own separate institution. There's always been a natural tension there\'97which, actually, to be honest, you can't get rid of entirely\'97between the operation of the funding of Parliament, the legislature, its own institution, and the executive, which, by definition, is only the executive because it has control of the Parliament; if that wasn't the case, they wouldn't be the executive. So what this bill does is put in place a more independent process in which the House is in charge of its own budgets, there is some involvement of the executive but it's a step forward from the status quo where I think most people would say it's more biased towards the Government. That hasn't really been a problem, to be honest\'97I hope both sides of the House would agree",Hon CHRIS BISHOP,2025
"On behalf of the Minister of Internal Affairs, I don't believe that that statement is correct. The Government in the last two years has seen FENZ introduce an asset management plan, which had not been put in place, for some reason, between 2017 and 2023 after FENZ was formed from the voluntary and professional wings of New Zealand's firefighting. The replacement schedule for fire appliances I traversed in detail yesterday, but the Government currently has, I believe, 78 appliances on order. They tend to take 18 to 24 months to deliver because they're highly specialised equipment; five of those are aerial. In total, FENZ is spending around $20 million to $25 million each year on upgrading fire appliances.",Hon DAVID SEYMOUR,2025

"A couple of things about that: first of all, the Prime Minister is absolutely willing to negotiate with the unions. In fact, the Government has been saying, through the Public Service Commission, that we are prepared to meet and work through the weekend to get a deal to avoid these strikes. The Government is here making the offers, trying to get the Public Service back to work in order for people to be served and we can make a balanced Budget on behalf of New Zealanders for all of our economic future. Now, on the comment about the Prime Minister's personal capacity and his personal residence, there's no responsibility for that except to say that there is a tone that if someone's worked hard all their life and done well, they should be dragged down and they should be embarrassed about their success and having a nice place on Waiheke.

"The House has chosen to set aside an hour of its time to debate energy issues, something that says it's a serious issue for this country, something we really need to work on, hopefully, in many ways, in a bipartisan way, because there is much that we can agree on in the energy space. What I want to do, however, is to take this debate first back to defining what some of the issues are in the energy space. When I say to think about it, I thought, well, here are the three broad areas of concern around energy in New Zealand. The first is around supply\'97sufficiency and certainty of supply\'97the second is around pricing, and the third is around climate. So let me just talk through each of those issues and why they are a particular concern for us. I'll start with supply and certainty of supply. Of course, what has been affecting the country today does point to that in some regards. So we know that right at the moment around about 90,000 households are without power. I don't know how many businesses are without power, but, given that many households are out, so many businesses will be too. I heard there's some quite big outages in Southland. There must be some farmers there who are a bit worried about milking and how that's going to happen. Of course, the outages today have been caused by the massive storm through the country. I'm sure that the thoughts of everyone in this House are with the people who are affected directly by the storm and with the workers who are out there trying to get the power back on\'97I know they'll be working hard out there. But that certainty of supply can",Hon Dr DEBORAH RUSSELL,2025
